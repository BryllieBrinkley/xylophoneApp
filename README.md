# xylophoneApp

    Here is a beautiful xylophone application developed with Swift programming language and AVFoundation framework. Throughout the development of this app, I gained a deeper understanding of Swift functions, including how to create functions with inputs and group functionality together. I also learned how to link multiple UI elements to a single IBAction to enable sound playing functionality whenever the user taps any button on the xylophone. Additionally, I delved into implementing distinct sounds for each button using function inputs. Lastly, I discovered how to troubleshoot any programming issues by researching solutions online, such as using Stack Overflow, in addition to referring to the official Apple documentation. What I enjoyed most about this app was learning how to play songs on the xylophone and demonstrating my musical abilities to my loved ones and friends!
